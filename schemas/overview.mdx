Schemas serve as blueprints defining the structure and properties of each resource, enabling seamless integration and utilization of the Control Plane platform's functionalities.

In this category, you will find detailed information about the various schema objects available for interacting with our resources. Each schema page contains comprehensive documentation outlining the attributes and data types associated with the respective resource. These schemas are designed to be utilized across multiple interfaces, including our [API](/api-reference/api), [CLI](/api-reference/cli) and console.
