title:  Images

## [Overview](#overview)

An [image](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) is a "lightweight, standalone, executable package of software
that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings".

Control Plane offers its users their own hosted private image registry. Your application will be packaged
and stored as an image and will be served by a [Workload](/workload).

When configuring the source of the [Workload's](/workload) container image, you have the option of using either an external
private/public image registries, such as [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), or the internal private image registry offered
by the platform.

The [CLI](/api-reference/cli#image-build) contains the functionality to build and push your application to your private image registry.

## [Benefits](#benefits)

The benefits of using your Org's private image registry are:

- No [Pull Secrets](/secret) are required when configuring your workload.
- Minimizes latency when pulling the image into your container.
- Requires access permissions when pushing/pulling from outside the platform (e.g. using `Docker push/pull`).

## [Pull an Image](#pull-image)

Refer to the [Pull an Image](guides/pull-image) guide for additional details.

## [Push an Image](#push-image)

Refer to the [Push an Image](guides/push-image) guide for additional details.

## [Copy an image](#copy-image)

Using the [CLI](/cli#image-copy), to copy an image from one org to another, execute the following command:

```
cpln image copy IMAGE_NAME:TAG --org SOURCE_ORG --dest-org DESTINATION_ORG
```

## [Update an Image](#update-image)

Using the [CLI](/cli), to update the image a container is pulling, execute the following command:

```
cpln workload update WORKLOAD_NAME --set spec.containers.CONTAINER_NAME.image=IMAGE:TAG --gvc GVC_NAME --org ORG_NAME
```

**NOTE:** Use the convention `//image/IMAGE:TAG` to reference an image residing within the current Org's private repository.

## [Permissions](#permissions)

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/policy) together with one or more of
the four [principal types](concepts/principal_types):
```
<!-- PERMISSIONS-START -->

| Permission | Description                                              | Implies                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| create     | Create new image. You can push if you can create images. | pull                                     |
| delete     | Delete                                                   |                                          |
| edit       | Modify existing image (only tags can be changed)         | view                                     |
| manage     | Full access                                              | create, delete, edit, manage, pull, view |
| pull       | Image can be pulled                                      | view                                     |
| view       | Read-only access                                         |                                          |

## [Minimum Policy](#minimum-policy)

### [Push](#image-push)

At a minimum, the `create` permission must be bound to the principal pushing an image to an org's private registry.

Using the console UI, follow these steps to create a least privileged [policy](/policy) which will allow a principal to push an image:

1. Click `Policies` in the left menu bar and click the `New` button at the top of the form.
2. Enter a policy name, select `image` from the Target Kind pulldown, and enable the `Target All Images` button. Click the `Next` button.
3. Click `Add Binding`.
4. Select the `create` permission. Select the principal type that will be pushing the image from the top menu bar and select the principal. Click `Add`.
5. Click `Create`.

The policy is now active and the principal has the ability to push images to the org's private registry.

### [Pull](#image-pull)

At a minimum, the `pull` permission must be bound to a principal pulling an image from an org's private registry.

Unless the [policy](/policy) targets all images, a [query](cli#query) must be created with the image names (without the tag) that
the principal is allowed to pull. That [query](cli#query) uses the `property` parameter and can only be created/updated
using [cpln apply](guides/cpln-apply) or the CLI's [cpln profile](cli#policy) command.

Below is a sample JSON manifest used as input to `cpln apply`.

**Notice that the `property` parameter is equal to `repository`.**

Update the `POLICY_NAME`, `ORG_NAME`, `USER_EMAIL`, `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME`, and `IMAGE_NAME` tokens.

The `principalLinks` can refer to a user or service account.

```
{
  "kind": "policy",
  "name": "POLICY_NAME",
  "description": "",
  "tags": {},
  "origin": "default",
  "bindings": [
    {
      "permissions": [
        "pull"
      ],
      "principalLinks": [
        "/org/ORG_NAME/user/USER_EMAIL",
        "/org/ORG_NAME/serviceaccount/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "targetKind": "image",
  "targetLinks": [],
  "targetQuery": {
    "kind": "image",
    "fetch": "items",
    "spec": {
      "match": "all",
      "terms": [
        {
          "op": "=",
          "property": "repository",
          "value": "IMAGE_NAME"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once the policy is active, the principal will have the ability to pull images using any Docker compatible tool (e.g., `docker pull ...`).
