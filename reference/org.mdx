title: Org (Organization)
---

## Overview

An Org serves as a tightly isolated bounded context that encompasses all the resources managed by Control Plane. These resources comprise [domains](domain), [images](image), [workloads](workload), [GVCs](gvc), [users](user), [groups](group), [service accounts](serviceaccount), and more.

It's possible for a physical organization, to create multiple 'orgs,' although this is not mandatory. Creating multiple orgs can be beneficial in order to establish complete isolation between environments, for instance.

## Create an Org

Refer to the [Create an Org](/guides/create-org) guide.

## Multiple Orgs

A user can be a member of one or more Orgs.

- To switch between Orgs from the console:
  - From the left menu, click on the `>` to the right of the current org.
  - Search or scroll to the desired org.
  - Click on the desired org.
  - A confirmation modal will be displayed. Click `Yes`.

## External Logs / Logging

Control Plane offers the ability to ship all Org logs to an external provider.

Please [click here](/external-logging/overview) for additional details and configuration instructions.

## Tracing

OpenTelemetry traces are supported and can be configured with the native `Control Plane` tracing provider or sent to an OpenTelemetry collector endpoint by using the `OpenTelemetry` tracing provider.

### Control Plane tracing provider

The Control Plane tracing provider is the default method for collecting OpenTelemetry traces. They will be accessible for exploration using Grafana by accessing "Metrics" in the sidebar menu of the Console.

### Control Plane Tracing Provider

The Control Plane tracing provider is the default method for collecting OpenTelemetry traces. They will be accessible for exploration using Grafana by accessing `Metrics` in the sidebar menu of the Console.

To enable traces using the Console, navigate to your GVC, click on `Tracing`, and choose `Control Plane` as the metric provider. Then, configure the sampling percentage and, optionally, the Custom Tags.

Here is an example of a GVC with enabled tracing:

```yaml YAML
kind: gvc
name: online-boutique
spec:
  staticPlacement:
    locationLinks:
      - //location/aws-eu-central-1
      - //location/azure-eastus2
      - //location/gcp-us-west1
  tracing:
    provider:
      controlPlane: {}
    customTags: {}
    sampling: 100
```

### OpenTelemetry Tracing Provider

Similarly, traces can be sent to an OTEL collector endpoint using the `OpenTelemetry` tracing provider.

For details, see the [Online Boutique](https://github.com/controlplane-com/examples/blob/main/examples/online-boutique/README.md) example.

## Observability

The retention period for logs, metrics and traces defaults to 30 days and can be adjusted for each independently.

Charges apply for storage beyond the 30 day default.

## Session Timeout - Console UI

The console UI will automatically sign out if inactive for 15 minutes. This timeout duration is the
default setting (for [PCI compliance](/compliance#pci)) and can be modified.

This timeout setting (in seconds) can be adjusted from the `Info` page when clicking on the `Org` link from the left menu.

## Permissions

The permissions below are used to define [policies](policy) together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/concepts/principal_types):

| Permission       | Description                                                                    | Implies                                                                                               |
