## [Overview](#overview)

**Identity** (also known as a workload identity) is one of the four Control Plane [principal types](/concepts/principal_types) (users, service accounts, groups, and identities).

A [workload](workload) needing to consume cloud resources from one or more cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, and GCP) without storing credentials or
needing to communicate to endpoints within a private network - must be assigned an **identity**.

An **identity** is a named object that allows an authorized administrator to define:

### [Cloud Access (Universal Cloud Identity):](#cloud-access)

- Least-privilege access rules allowed on cloud resources across cloud providers. There can only be one account each being
  referenced from a particular identity. In other words, you can have one account in Azure and one account in GCP, but not two different
  accounts in GCP in the same identity. You define access policy granted to the identity within the three clouds, of course, you can use one,
  two or three clouds, depending on what the workload needs access to.

### [Network Resources (Cloud Wormhole):](#cloud-wormhole)

- Network traversal rules from [workloads](workload) into specific endpoints in private networks (e.g., a VPC).
  These rules connect an [agent](/api-reference/agent) in a private network to the Control Plane fabric allowing [workloads](workload) to selectively
  access TCP endpoints inside private networks where [agents](agent) are installed and running.

An **identity** is scoped to a [GVC](/api-reference/gvc) and can be assigned to multiple [workloads](workload) within the same [GVC](/api-reference/gvc)
needing the same cloud resources and network access.

A [workload](workload) can be assigned exactly one **identity**. An **identity** is only required when a [workload](workload)
needs to consume cloud resources without embedding credentials and/or when a [workload](workload) needs to consume resources
in a private network such as a VPC. If neither is required, a [workload](workload) can operate **without** assigning it an **identity**.

Once configured, an **identity** assigned to a [workload](workload) enables it to:

- Access specific resources of AWS, Azure, and/or GCP
- Tunnel [workload](workload) network requests to specific TCP endpoints within VPCs or other private networks. (Tunneling network traffic from
  [workloads](workload) to specific TCP hosts and ports is facilitated using [agents](agent). This capability is referred to as “wormholes”.)

<Warning>
Identities are powerful Control Plane resources that can be granted any permission to your cloud environment. The
ability to create identities should only be given to administrators by using a [policy](/api-reference/policy).

## [Create an Identity](#create)

Refer to the [Create an Identity](/guides/create-identity) guide for additional details.

## [Permissions](#permissions)

The permissions below are used to define [policies](/api-reference/policy) together with one or more of the four
[principal types](/concepts/principal_types):
```
<!-- PERMISSIONS-START -->

| Permission | Description                                                | Implies                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| create     | Create new identities                                      |                                         |
| delete     | Delete existing identities                                 |                                         |
| edit       | Modify existing identities                                 | view                                    |
| manage     | Full access                                                | create, delete, edit, manage, use, view |
| use        | Refer to this identity from other entities (workload, etc) | view                                    |
| view       | Read-only access                                           |                                         |
