title: External Logging
---

Log shipping to an external provider is a data replication and disaster recovery strategy used to keep a copy of server logs in an off-site location, often hosted by a third-party service provider. This approach ensures that critical server logs are safely stored in a separate location, providing an additional layer of protection in case of data loss, server failure, or other emergencies.

When logs are shipped to an external provider, all logs will remain accessible through Control Plane, adhering to the [current log retention policy](/reference/logs#log-retention).

Log shipping can be configured to multiple external providers.

Control Plane offers the ability to ship all Org logs to the following providers:

1. [Amazon S3](s3)
2. [Coralogix](coralogix)
3. [Datadog](datadog)
4. [Logz.io](logz-io)
