title:  Configure a Domain
---

## [Overview](#overview)

Follow the steps below to configure a custom [Domain](/api-reference/domain) within your [Org](/api-reference/org).

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- Review the [Domain](/api-reference/domain) reference page.
- [Permissions](/api-reference/policy#permissions) to configure a [Domain](/api-reference/domain).
- Access to a domain name and the ability to update its DNS records.
- Optional:
  - Install the [CLI](/api-reference/cli).

## [Step One - APEX Domain Verification](#step-1)

Follow step one in the [domain quick start](quickstart/quick-start-2-custom-domain#step-1) to create and verify the apex domain name using the Console UI.

The CLI can also be used to create the apex domain for verification and routing configuration. See the [sample manifiest files](#cli-apex-verification) below.

Refer to the [Domain Verification](/api-reference/domain#verification) section within the
Domain reference page for additional details.

## [Step Two - Create Domain](#step-2)

A [Domain](/api-reference/domain) can be created using the following methods:

- [Console UI](#create-using-ui)
- [CLI](#create-using-cli)
- [Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/controlplane-com/cpln/latest/docs/resources/domain)

### [Create using the UI Console](#create-using-ui)

Follow step two in the [domain quick start](quickstart/quick-start-2-custom-domain#step-2) for detailed instruction on how to create and configure your domain name using the console UI.

### [Create using the CLI](#create-using-cli)

A Domain can be created / updated using the [CLI's apply](/cpln-apply) command.

Below are a few sample Domain manifests (in YAML) that can be used as input to the [CLI's apply](/cpln-apply) command.

After updating and saving the manifests to a local file, execute the following command to apply:

```
cpln apply -f FILE_NAME.yaml --org ORG_NAME
```

<Warning>
Before using the [CLI's apply](/cpln-apply) command, the [TXT DNS records](#dns-records) must exist
and be propagated **only** for the apex domain. The DNS entries for the subdomain will not be verified on creation. Routing and
certificate generation will not occur until the records have been added, propagated, and the target workload is in a ready state and
can serve requests.
</Warning>

#### [APEX Verification Only](#cli-apex-verification)

Configure Domain for APEX Verification

- Substitute `example.com` with your domain.

```
kind: domain
name: example.com
description: example.com
spec:
  dnsMode: cname
```

#### [APEX Verification and Path Based Routing](#cli-apex-path-based)

Configure Domain for APEX Verification and Path Based Routing.

- Substitute `example.com` with your domain, GVC_NAME, and WORKLOAD_NAME
- The example YAML manifest below assumes there is a workload named WORKLOAD_NAME serving requests on port 4200 in the GVC named GVC_NAME.

```
kind: domain
name: example.com
description: example.com
tags: {}
spec:
  acceptAllHosts: false
  dnsMode: cname
  ports:
    - number: 443
      protocol: http2
      routes:
        - port: 4200
          prefix: /
          workloadLink: //gvc/GVC_NAME/workload/WORKLOAD_NAME

```

#### [APEX Verification and Subdomain Based Routing](#cli-apex-subdomain-based)

Configure Domain for APEX Verification and Subdomain Based Routing.

- Substitute `example.com` with your domain, GVC_NAME, and TLS_SECRET
- Notice that the `dnsMode` is set to `cname` and a TLS secret is required.

```
kind: domain
name: example.com
description: example.com
tags: {}
spec:
  dnsMode: cname
  gvcLink: //gvc/GVC_NAME
  ports:
    - number: 443
      tls:
        serverCertificate:
          secretLink: //secret/TLS_SECRET
```

#### [Subdomain and Path Based Routing](#cli-subdomain-path-based)

Configure a subdomain for path based routing.

- Substitute `sub.example.com` with your domain, GVC_NAME, and WORKLOAD_NAME.
- The example YAML manifest below assumes there is a workload named WORKLOAD_NAME in the GVC named GVC_NAME.

```
kind: domain
name: sub.example.com
description: sub.example.com
tags: {}
  spec:
  dnsMode: cname
  ports:
    - routes:
        - prefix: /
          workloadLink: //gvc/GVC_NAME/workload/WORKLOAD_NAME
```

#### [Subdomain and Subdomain Based Routing](#cli-subdomain-subdomain-based)

Configure a subdomain for subdomain based routing.

- Substitute `sub.example.com` with your domain and GVC_NAME.
- All workloads within the GVC will have endpoints created with the subdomain in the format: `https://WORKLOAD_NAME.sub.example.com/`.

```
kind: domain
name: sub.example.com
description: sub.example.com
tags: {}
spec:
  dnsMode: ns
  gvcLink: //gvc/GVC_NAME
```

#### [Complete Domain YAML Manifest](#domain-manifest)

Use the manifest YAML templates below to create a Domain per your requirements.

<Note>
The examples above use the minimum properties required to create/update a domain based on your requirements.

The complete YAML manifest templates below contain both the required and optional properties.

Notes:

- `dnsMode` can either be `cname` (for path based) or `ns` (for subdomain based). For an apex domain, it must be `cname`.
- `acceptAllHosts` will only be active if the dedicated load balancer is enabled on the GVC.
- For the routes configued for path based routing, the `hostPrefix` will only be active if the dedicated load balancer
  is enabled on the GVC **and** the `acceptAllHosts` propert is set to `true`.
</Note>

- Path Based Routing

## [Required DNS Records](#dns-records)

To successfully add a [Domain](/api-reference/domain) to your [Org](/api-reference/org), DNS records are required to be added.

The values in the sample below might not correspond to the entries necessary for your domain. Use the values that are presented
during the creation of the domain.

When created the domain with the console UI, the final step will display the DNS records that need to be added.

These records will need to be sent to the network administrator in charge of handling the domain's DNS configuration.

**Example:**

- Apex Domain - CNAME Mode Only:

| RECORD/HOST | TYPE | TTL | VALUE       |
| ----------- | ---- | --- | ----------- |
| \_cpln      | TXT  | 600 | ORG_ID_GUID |

- Subdomain (e.g., **sample.domain.com**) - CNAME Mode (Path Based Routing)

| RECORD/HOST   | TYPE  | TTL | VALUE              |
| ------------- | ----- | --- | ------------------ |
| \_cpln-sample | TXT   | 600 | ORG_ID_GUID        |
| sample        | CNAME | 600 | GVC_ALIAS.cpln.app |

**Note:** The GVC_ALIAS can be obtain from the console UI by clicking on the GVC and it will be displayed on the `Info` page.
Using the CLI, executing the command `cpln gvc get GVC_NAME` will output the alias.

- Subdomain (e.g., **sample.domain.com**) - NS Mode (Subdomain Based Routing)

| RECORD/HOST   | TYPE | TTL  | VALUE          |
| ------------- | ---- | ---- | -------------- |
| \_cpln-sample | TXT  | 600  | ORG_ID_GUID    |
| sample        | NS   | 1800 | ns1.cpln.cloud |
| sample        | NS   | 1800 | ns2.cpln.cloud |
| sample        | NS   | 1800 | ns1.cpln.live  |
| sample        | NS   | 1800 | ns2.cpln.live  |

<Note>
In the examples above, the TXT record for the subdomain is **only** required if the domain is created in an Org that doesn't contain the apex domain.
ORG_ID_GUID should be set to the`id` value of the Org object.
The record `_cpln-sample` is generated from the last segment of the domain, `_cpln-${lastSegment}`.
In the case of an apex domain, the TXT record to add is `_cpln`.

The TXT record can include the ID of multiple Orgs in cases
where the domain is allowed to be used in multiple Orgs.

The verification record can exist at any segment of the Domain.

For example, the subdomain, two.sample.domain.com can be verified using **any** of the following TXT records:

- \_cpln-two.sample.domain.com
- \_cpln-sample.domain.com
- \_cpln.domain.com
</Note>

<Tip>
To obtain the ORG_ID_GUID, run the CLI command: `cpln org get ORG_NAME --output json`.

The output of the command will display all the properties of the [Org](/api-reference/org) object. Use the value of the `id` key for the TXT value.
</Tip>

<Note>
After the DNS records have been created, the propagation time for the changes to take
effect depends on the cache setting of your domain's DNS Start of Authority (SOA) record.

Once the records are fully propagated, any DNS changes to your subdomain will be reflected
within a few seconds.
</Note>

## [Configure a Content Delivery Network (CDN) Domain](#configure-cdn)

Refer to the [Configure a CDN](configure-cdn) guide.

## [Advanced Mode](#advanced-mode)

When editing a domain within the console UI, the following options are available when clicking `Advanced Mode`:

### [Dedicated Load Balancing](#dedicated-load-balancing)

Refer to the following pages for details on enabling dedicated load balancing:

- Configuring the [GVC for dedicated load balancing.](/api-reference/gvc#load-balancer)
- After enabling, these [additional domain configuration options](/api-reference/domain#dedicated) will be available for configuration.

### [Additional Setting](#additional-setting)

- The [accept all hosts](/api-reference/domain#accept-all-hosts) setting (`acceptAllHosts`
  in the above example manifest) can be enabled when dedicated load balancing is enabled.
- [Add additional ports](/api-reference/domain#external-port) configured with other supported protocols (TCP, etc.) when using a dedicated load balancer.

  - For each port, configure [TLS Settings](/api-reference/domain#tls-settings) which includes setting the TLS version, forwarding client certificates,
    using custom server certificates, and allowed cipher suites.

  - For each port, configure custom [CORS](/api-reference/domain#cors-settings) settings.

- When using Path Based Routing:
  - Additional [routes](/api-reference/domain#path-based-routing) can be added with unique prefixes and, optionally, a replace prefix.
  - When dedicated load balancing is enabled, a [host prefix](/api-reference/domain#host-prefix) (`hostPrefix` in the above example manifest) can be optionally defined.
