title:  Rate Limiting
---

Rate limiting can be added to [Workloads](/api-reference/workload) by configuring an endpoint
which serves the Envoy Rate Limit project. This endpoint receives a rate limit request from a configured Workload and
decides if the request should be limited.

Follow the steps below to configure your [Workload](/api-reference/workload) with a
rate limiting policy.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- An existing [Workload](/api-reference/workload) that requires rate limiting.
- Review the Rate Limiting project's [README](https://github.com/envoyproxy/ratelimit).

## [Configuration Steps](#configuration-steps)

Envoy's Rate Limit project is deployed as a Workload at Control Plane and requires a local Redis Workload.

Follow the steps below to download and apply a YAML manifiest file which will deploy, create, and configure:

- The Rate Limit Workload.
- The Redis Workload.
- An [opaque secret](/api-reference/secret#opaque) containing the rate limiting definition.
- A [Workload Identity](/api-reference/identity) for the Rate Limit Workload.
- A [Policy](/api-reference/policy) allowing the Rate Limit Workload to reveal the secret.

### Step One - Configure the Rate Limiting Workload(#step-1) 

- Download and review the [YAML manifest file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/controlplane-com/examples/main/examples/rate-limiting/rate-limiting.yaml) that will be applied.
- Using the UI or CLI:
  - Create a [GVC](/api-reference/gvc) named `ratelimit`. If you choose a different GVC name, update
    the YAML manifest file accordingly.
  - Within that GVC, use the [cpln apply](/cpln-apply) command to deploy the manifest file.

<Tip>
The latest `envoyproxy/ratelimit` deployment can be obtained [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/envoyproxy/ratelimit/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated).

The downloaded YAML manifest file uses the image `envoyproxy/ratelimit:5b6e65da`. If there is a newer tag, it can be substituted in
the YAML file before executing the `cpln apply` command.
</Tip>

### Step Two - Customize the Config File(#step-2) 

The rate limit config file is stored as an [opaque secret](/api-reference/secret#opaque)
named `ratelimit-config` that was created when applying the YAML manifest file.

The configuration that was deployed with the manifest file sets a limit of 10 requests per minute for any
request that contains an `authorization` header (see sample config below).

To adjust the rate limit per your requirments, use the UI or CLI to edit the `ratelimit-config` secret using the pattern
referenced [here](https://github.com/envoyproxy/ratelimit#configuration).

**Sample Config:**

```yaml
domain: cpln
descriptors:
  - key: authorization
    rate_limit:
      unit: minute
      requests_per_unit: 10
```

**NOTE:** After saving the updated secret, it's recommended to perform a `Force Redeploy` of the `ratelimit` Workload to reload the
config file.

### Step Three - Configure Rate Limiting on a Workload(#step-3) 

Add the following [tags](/api-reference/misc#tags) to enable rate limiting
on the desired [Workload](/api-reference/workload).

- `cpln/rateLimitAddress`
  - **Required**
  - Use the `Global Endpoint` of the Rate Limiting Workload that was configured in [step one](#step-1). This endpoint
    can be obtained by browsing to the `Info` page of the `ratelimit` Workload. Do not include the `https://` scheme.
- `cpln/rateLimitScheme`
  - Optional.
  - Default is: `https:`.
- `cpln/rateLimitPort`
  - Optional.
  - Default is: `443`.
- `cpln/rateLimitDomain`
  - Optional.
  - Default is: `cpln`.
  - This value corresponds to the domain entry within the config file that was configured in [step 2](#step-2).
- `cpln/rateLimitDescriptors`
  - Optional. Default is: `authorization`.
  - Allowed values: `authorization`, `host`, `port`.
  - This value corresponds to the descriptor entry within the config file that was configured in [step 2](#step-2).

After saving these tags and the Workload has deployed successfuly, the rate limits defined within the config file will be
enforced. If a client hits the limit, an HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) response will be returned.
