---

Click on the desired cloud provider and follow the installation and configuration instructions:

- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](#setup-agent-aws)
- [Microsoft Azure](#setup-agent-azure)
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](#setup-agent-gcp)
- [Private Network](#setup-agent-private-network)
- [Kubernetes (k8s) Cluster](#setup-agent-k8s)

## [AWS](#setup-agent-aws)

### [Overview](#overview-aws)

Follow the steps below to install and configure an [agent](/api-reference/agent) within your Amazon Web Services (AWS) environment.

### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-aws)

- Review the [Agent](/api-reference/agent) reference page.
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) account.

### [Step One - Create an Agent](#step-1-aws)

Follow the [Create an Agent](agent) guide to define an agent and generate the bootstrap config file that will be used in
[step two](#step-2-aws).

### [Step Two - Launch an agent in AWS](#step-2-aws)

1. Log in to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com).
2. Click this [link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-dq5cug2iej46m) to be directed to the `Control Plane Secure Communications Agent` within the AWS Marketplace.
   - For the `ARM`s version of the agent, [click here](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-fvvtn73sdxxos).
3. Click the `Continue to Subscribe` button in the upper right corner.
4. After reading the terms and conditions, click the `Accept Terms`.
5. After the subscription has loaded, click the `Continue to Configuration` button in the upper right corner.
6. Click the `region` pull-down and select the region where your AWS resources reside.
7. Click the `Continue to Launch` button in the upper right corner.
8. Click the `Choose Action` pull-down and select `Launch through EC2`. Click the `Launch` button.
9. The `Launch an instance` wizard will be displayed.
10. Under the `Name and tag` section, enter the agent's name. (e.g., `cpln-agent`).
11. Under the `Instance type` section, select an applicable instance type.

<Tip>
Refer to the [Agent Sizing Guidance](/api-reference/agent#agent-sizing-guidance) page for
additional details on which instance type to select.
</Tip>

12. `Optional:` Under the `Key pair(login)` section, select or create a new key pair to
    enable SSH access to the agent. A key pair is necessary only for accessing the
    agent during troubleshooting.

<Tip>
If you do not have an AWS key-pair created, the console will help you to create one.

Since the agent instance will never need to be connected to (except for troubleshooting),
you may proceed without a key-pair.
</Tip>

13. Under the `Network setting` section, review the details and verify that the selected VPC is the same as the AWS resource you are trying to access.

<Tip>
For the agent to properly connect to the Control Plane servers, it requires outbound Internet access.

Verify that the `Auto-assign Public IP` option is set to `Enable`.

If your requirements do not allow the instance to have a public IP, please review the section
`How do instances without public IP addresses access the Internet` in this [AWS FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/faqs/).

Either create or select an existing security group. The security groups belonging to the resources that the agent will need to
have access to will require to have the security group belonging to the agent added to its list of allowed inbound traffic.

Initially, remove the checkbox for the "Allow SSH from" property. SSH access is only necessary for troubleshooting purposes. Control Plane will never need to connect directly to the agent.
</Tip>

14. Under the `Configure storage` section, click the `Advanced` link and expand the volume property. Modify the `Delete on termination`
    dropdown to `Yes`. This will ensure the associated volume is removed if the agent is terminated, thereby preventing any orphaned volumes.

15. Expand the `Advanced details` section. Scroll to the bottom and paste the contents
    of the JSON payload generated in [step one](#step-1-aws) within the `User data` textbox.
    Please review the other properties in this section to check if any default values
    need to be modified.

16. Click `Launch instance` in the lower right corner.

17. After a brief moment, the instance will launch and be ready to process requests.

### [Next Steps](#next-steps-aws)

Now that you have an agent configured and running, it can be used within an [identity](/api-reference/identity) to allow your
[workload](/api-reference/workload) to connect to your internal AWS resources.

### [Next Steps](#next-steps-azure)

Now that you have an agent configured and running, it can be used within an [identity](/api-reference/identity) to allow your
[workload](/api-reference/workload) to connect to your internal Azure resources.

## [GCP](#setup-agent-gcp)

### [Overview](#overview-gcp)

Follow the steps below to install and configure an [agent](/api-reference/agent) within your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) environment.

### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-gcp)

- Review the [Agent](/api-reference/agent) reference page
- [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/) account.

### [Step One - Create an Agent](#step-1-gcp)

Follow the [Create an Agent](agent) guide to define an agent and generate the bootstrap config file that will be used in
[step two](#step-2-gcp).

### [Step Two - Launch agent in GCP](#step-2-gcp)

- Using the Google Cloud SDK

1. Install the latest [SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
2. If necessary, log in using `gcloud init`.
3. Execute the command in the note below. Ensure that the instance will be deployed in the same VPC and region as your GCP resources.
   Use a unique `INSTANCE_NAME` and the bootstrap file `(AGENT_NAME-bootstrapConfig.json)` that was created in [step one](#step-1-gcp).

<Note>
gcloud compute instances create **INSTANCE_NAME** --image controlplane-agent-1398-958088785-43dce8055 --image-project cpln-build --metadata-from-file=user-data=**AGENT_NAME-bootstrapConfig.json**
</Note>

<Tip>
Refer to the [Agent Sizing Guidance](/api-reference/agent#agent-sizing-guidance) page for
additional details on which machine type to select.

Add the flag `--machine-type=MACHINE_TYPE` to the command above to select a different type. Otherwise, the default type is
`n1-standard-1`.
</Tip>

4. After a few moments, the command will return and show the status of the deployed instance.
5. The agent will now be running, connecting to the Control Plane servers, and ready to process requests.

### [Step Three - Configure Firewall](#step-3-gcp)

By default, the GCP firewall rules open the common SSH, RDP, and ICMP ports to the world and allows all internal ports within the
VPC. The agent does not need any of these ports open.

At a minimum, the agent needs to be able to connect to your GCP resources and the Internet.

### [Next Steps](#next-steps-gcp)

Now that you have an agent configured and running, it can be used within an [identity](/api-reference/identity) to allow your
[workload](/api-reference/workload) to connect to your internal GCP resources.

## [Private Network](#setup-agent-private-network)

### [Overview](#overview-local)

Follow the steps below to install and configure an [agent](/api-reference/agent) within your private network.

### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-local)

- Review the [Agent](/api-reference/agent) reference page.
- Install the [CLI](/api-reference/cli).
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### [Step One - Create an Agent](#step-1-local)

Follow the [Create an Agent](agent) guide to define an agent and generate the bootstrap config file that will be used in
[step two](#step-2-local).

### [Step Two - Launch agent locally](#step-2-local)

1. Open a new shell and execute the following command. Use the bootstrap file that was created in [step one](#step-1-local).

```
cpln agent up --bootstrap-file=PATH/AGENT_NAME-bootstrapConfig.json
```

<Tip>
If you are using Windows, follow these instructions:

- Configure Docker to **not** use the WSL 2 based engine.
- Run the `cpln` command above using a Windows command prompt and not using WSL.
</Tip>

2. The agent will now be running, connecting to the Control Plane servers, and ready to process requests.

### [Next Steps](#next-steps-local)

Now that you have an agent configured and running, it can be used within an [identity](/api-reference/identity) to allow your
[workload](/api-reference/workload) to connect to your local resources.

<Tip>
When running an agent locally, it is running within a local Docker container. When configuring an [identity
network resource](/api-reference/identity#network-resource), you must use the IP of the network adapter that Docker installed on the
local machine.
</Tip>

## [Kubernetes (k8s) Cluster](#setup-agent-k8s)

### [Overview](#overview-k8s)

Follow the steps below to install and configure an [agent](/api-reference/agent) within your k8s cluster.

### [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-k8s)

- Review the [Agent](/api-reference/agent) reference page.
- Install the [CLI](/api-reference/cli).

### [Step One - Create an Agent](#step-1-k8s)

Follow the [Create an Agent](agent) guide to define an agent and generate the bootstrap config file that will be used in
[step two](#step-2-local).

### [Step Two - Launch agent within a k8s cluster](#step-2-k8s)

1. Open a new shell and execute the following command. Update tokens as necessary. Use the bootstrap file that was created in [step one](#step-1-k8s).

```

cpln agent manifest --bootstrap-file bootstrap.json  --namespace NAMESPACE  --replicas 2 --cluster CLUSTER_ID > manifest.yaml

# inspect/modify the manifest file manually, if needed.
kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml

```

`cpln` will generate the manifest.yaml file that will deploy two replicas of the agent to the namespace of your
choice (`NAMESPACE` in the example). The parameter `--cluster CLUSTER_ID` will be added to the agent's status
which is used as a hint to know which cluster an agent has been deploy to.

It is recommended to use --replicas=2 for high availability (HA).

On startup, the agent will generate a public/private key-pair which is persisted as a k8s secret.
In this scenario, the agents run under a k8s service account, which can create/modify secrets in its own namespace.
If this is a concern, the agent can be configured to run in a dedicated namespace.

2. The agent will now be running, connecting to the Control Plane servers, and ready to process requests.

### [Next Steps](#next-steps-k8s)

Now that you have an agent configured and running, it can be used within an [identity](/api-reference/identity) to allow your
[workload](/api-reference/workload) to connect to your local resources.
