title:  cpln workload connect
---

## [Overview](#overview)

The [cpln workload connect](/api-reference/cli#workload-connect) command is designed to establish a direct remote terminal connection to your workload replica at a specific location, allowing you to interact with the terminal session of the workload replica. This guide outlines how to effectively use the [workload connect](/api-reference/cli#workload-connect) command, enabling you to perform tasks such as troubleshooting.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- [CLI](/api-reference/cli) installed and [authenticated](/manage-profile) with a default profile, [org](/api-reference/org) and [gvc](/api-reference/gvc).
- A running [workload](/api-reference/workload) in at least one location. Refer to our [create a workload](create-workload) guide.
- Permissions to interact with the [workload](/api-reference/workload#permissions).

## [Options](#options)

### [Required](#options-required)

- `--location`
  - The location associated with the workload deployment (e.g., `aws-us-west-1`).

### [Optional](#options-optional)

- `--replica`
  - The replica name associated with the workload deployment. Defaults to the first replica.
- `--container`
  - The container name associated with the workload deployment. Defaults to the first container.
- `shell`, `-s`
  - The shell to use upon connecting to the workload replica. Defaults to `bash`.

## [Basic Connect](#basic-connect)

To initiate a basic connection, you need the workload's name and its deployment location.

#### [Retrieve Workload Deployments](#retrieve-deployments)

```
cpln workload get-deployments WORKLOAD_NAME
```

This command lists the available locations. Identify the location name from the output.

#### [Connect to Workload](#connect-to-workload)

Example usage:

```
cpln workload connect WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION
```

This command connects to the first replica and container in the specified location.

## [Advanced Connect](#advanced-connect)

### [Specific Replica](#connect-replica)

In cases where there are more than one replica in a workload deployment and you would like to connect to a specific one, you can provide the `--replica` option followed by the replicas name.

#### [List Replicas](#list-replicas)

```
cpln workload replica get WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION
```

To override the output format, use the `--output` option followed by the desired format (YAML, JSON, etc.).

#### [Connect to a Replica](#connect-replica-usage)

Example usage:

```
cpln workload connect WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION --replica REPLICA_NAME
```

### [Specific Container](#connect-container)

Within a workload where numerous containers are configured, regardless if a container is handling traffic or functioning as a sidecar, it is feasible to establish a connection to it by using the `--container` option.

Example usage:

```
cpln workload connect WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION --container CONTAINER_NAME
```

### [Specific Shell](#connect-shell)

Different container environments may require or support different shells environments in order to connect, such as `bash` or `sh`.

To specify the shell, use the `--shell` option.

Example usage:

```
cpln workload connect WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION --shell SHELL_NAME
```
