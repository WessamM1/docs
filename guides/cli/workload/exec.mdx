title:  cpln workload exec
---

## [Overview](#overview)

The [cpln workload exec](/api-reference/cli#workload-exec) command lets you execute a specific
command followed by custom arguments in a workload replica at a specific location.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- [CLI](/api-reference/cli) installed and [authenticated](/manage-profile) with a default profile, [org](/api-reference/org) and [gvc](/api-reference/gvc).
- A running [workload](/api-reference/workload) in at least one location. Refer to our [create a workload](create-workload) guide.
- Permissions to interact with the [workload](/api-reference/workload#permissions).

## [Options](#options)

### [Required](#options-required)

- `--location`
  - The location associated with the workload deployment (e.g., `aws-us-west-1`).
- `--`
  - Command to execute on replica (e.g., `echo hello world`).

### [Optional](#options-optional)

- `--replica`
  - The replica name associated with the workload deployment. Defaults to the first replica.
- `--container`
  - The container name associated with the workload deployment. Defaults to the first container.

## [Basic Execute](#basic-exec)

#### [Retrieve Workload Deployments](#retrieve-deployments)

```
cpln workload get-deployments WORKLOAD_NAME
```

This command lists available locations. Identify the location name from the output.

#### [Execute](#basic-exec-usage)

Example usage:

```
cpln workload exec WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION -- COMMAND ARG1 ARG2
```

## [Advanced Execute](#advanced-exec)

### [Specific Replica](#exec-replica)

In cases where you have more than one replica in a workload deployment and you would like to execute a command in one of them, you can provide the `--replica` option followed by the replicas name.

#### [List Replicas](#list-replicas)

```
cpln workload replica get WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION
```

To override the output format, use the `--output` option followed by the desired format (YAML, JSON, etc.).

#### [Execute Within a Specific Replica](#exec-replica-usage)

Example usage:

```
cpln workload exec WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION --replica REPLICA_NAME -- COMMAND ARG1 ARG2
```

### [Specific Container](#exec-container)

Within a workload where numerous containers are configured, regardless if a container is handling traffic or functioning as a sidecar, it is feasible to execute a command to it by using the `--container` option.

Example usage:

```
cpln workload exec WORKLOAD_NAME --location LOCATION --container CONTAINER_NAME -- COMMAND ARG1 ARG2
```
