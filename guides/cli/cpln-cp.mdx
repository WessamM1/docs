## Overview

Copy files and directories to and from [workload containers](/reference/workload#containers).

<Warning>

IMPORTANT

Requires that the `tar` binary is present in your workload container image. If `tar` is not present, `cpln cp` will fail.

</Warning>

## Prerequisites

- [CLI](/reference/cli) installed.
- A running [workload](/reference/workload) in at least one location. Refer to our [create a workload](/guides/create-workload) guide.
- Permissions to interact with the [workload](/reference/workload#permissions).

## Options

### Required

- `--location`
  - The location associated with the workload deployment (e.g., `aws-us-west-1`).

### Optional

- `--replica`
  - The replica name associated with the workload deployment. Defaults to the first replica.
- `--container`
  - The container name associated with the workload deployment. Defaults to the first container.

## Copy from Local to Workload

```
cpln cp <source-path> <workload-name>:<destination-path> --location <location> --org <org> --gvc <gvc>
```

### Example Usage

To copy a local file or directory to a workload, use the following examples:

#### Copying a File from Local to Workload

To copy a local file `demo-file.txt` to the `tmp/` directory in a workload named `demo-workload` that is associated with the GVC `demo-gvc` and the location `aws-us-west-1`, run:

```
cpln cp demo-file.txt demo-workload:tmp/ --location aws-us-west-1 --org demo-org --gvc demo-gvc
```

#### Copying a Directory from Local to Workload

To copy a local directory `demo-directory` to the `tmp/` directory in a workload named `demo-workload`, that is associated with the GVC `demo-gvc` and the location `aws-us-west-1`, run:

```
cpln cp demo-directory demo-workload:tmp/ --location aws-us-west-1 --org demo-org --gvc demo-gvc
```

## Copy from Workload to Local

```
cpln cp <workload-name>:<source-path> <destination-path> --location <location-name> --org <org> --gvc <gvc>
```

### Example Usage

To copy a file or directory from a workload to a path within a local machine, use the following examples:

#### Copying a File from Workload to Local

To copy the file `tmp/demo-file.txt` from a workload named `demo-workload`, that is associated with the GVC `demo-gvc` and the location `aws-us-west-1`, to a path within your local machine, run:

```
cpln cp demo-workload:tmp/demo-file.txt /path/within/local/machine --location aws-us-west-1 --org demo-org --gvc demo-gvc
```

#### Copying a Directory from Workload to Local

To copy the directory `tmp/demo-directory` from a workload named `demo-workload`, that is associated with the GVC `demo-gvc` and the location `aws-us-west-1`, to a path within your local machine, run:

```
cpln cp demo-workload:tmp/demo-directory /path/within/local/machine --location aws-us-west-1 --org demo-org --gvc demo-gvc
```
