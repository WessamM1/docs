title:  Deploy From Docker-Compose
---

## [Overview](#overview)

Using the [CLI](/api-reference/cli), you can deploy docker-compose resources directly to Control Plane.

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- [Permissions](/api-reference/policy#permissions) to push an [image](/api-reference/image)
- [Permissions](/api-reference/policy#permissions) to create a [workload](/api-reference/workload), [volumeset](/api-reference/volumeset), [secret](/api-reference/secret), [identity](/api-reference/identity)
- Install the [CLI](/api-reference/cli)
- A docker-compose project

## Deploy project

Refer to the [stack deploy](/api-reference/cli#stack-deploy) command for details and examples on how to deploy from a docker-compose project.

## Delete project

Refer to the [stack rm](/api-reference/cli#stack-remove) command for details and examples on how to delete resources generated by a docker-compose project.

## Generate Control Plane Spec

You can generate a Control Plane spec without deploying the resources.
Refer to the [stack manifest](/api-reference/cli#stack-manifest) command for details and examples on how generate a Control Plane spec from a docker-compose project.

## Requirements
- Service-to-service connections must use the [CPLN local syntax](/guides/service-to-service#service-syntax) for host name.
  - Workload name would be the service name in this case.
  - E.g., if service1 connects to service to using `http://service2:8080`, this must be replaced with `http://service2.{GVC}.cpln.local:8080`
- Docker Compose file must specify all ports to be exposed, even just internally exposed ports.

## Translation Notes
- Compose services become single container workloads
- Compose networks are used to configure the internal firewall of the workload
- Compose volumes are converted to volumesets, with 10gb storage
- Compose secrets, conifgs, and file bind mounts are converted to [secrets](/api-reference/secret). Necessary [policies](/api-reference/policy) and [identities](/api-reference/identity) will be created.
- All external outbound requests are enabled by default, unless `network_mode` is set to `none`
- `deploy.resource.limit.cpus` and `deploy.resource.limit.memory` will determine cpu and memory allocation respectively.
- Default cpu and memory (if above not specified) set to 42m and 128Mi respectively
- Environment variables determined from `environment` field and/or `env_file`
- `ports` and `expose` field maps to container ports
  - Note: We only use the container port, not host port. Other services MUST connect to the container port.
- Capacity AI will be enabled if `deploy.resources.reservations` < `deploy.resources.limits`
- `deploy.replicas` will determine replica count (min AND max)
- `healthcheck` values will map to readiness probe
- Services with a GPU device will have GPU enabled. 
  - Note: cpu and memory values may have to be increased if GPU is enabled.
