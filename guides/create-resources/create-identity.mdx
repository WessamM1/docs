title:  Create an Identity
---

## [Overview](#overview)

Follow the steps below to create an [identity](/api-reference/identity) within your [GVC](/api-reference/gvc).

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- Review the [identity](/api-reference/identity) reference page
- [Permissions](/api-reference/identity#permissions) to create an [identity](/api-reference/identity)
- Optional:
  - Install the [CLI](/api-reference/cli)

## [Create using the UI Console](#create-ui)

Follow the steps below to create an identity (requires a [GVC](/api-reference/gvc)):

1.  Create a new identity using one of the following methods:
    - Clicking `Identities` in the left menu and click `New`, or
    - Click the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner and select `Identity`.
2.  Enter a unique name and optional description. Click `Next (Cloud Access)`.
3.  Select one of the cloud providers and follow the wizard to configure a cloud access rule. The wizard requires at least one
    [cloud account](/api-reference/cloudaccount) for the chosen provider to be defined. Depending on the use case of this identity, creating a cloud
    access definition is optional. See [Cloud Access](#cloud-access) for additional details. Click `Next (Network Resources)`.
4.  Click `Add Network Resource` and follow the wizard to configure a network resource. The wizard requires at least one [agent](/api-reference/agent)
    to exist. Each identity can have multiple network resources defined. Depending on the use case of this identity, creating a network
    resource is optional. See [Network Resource](#network-resource) for additional details. Click `Next (Tags)`.
5.  Enter any optional [tags](/api-reference/misc#tags). Click `Create`.
6.  The identity has been successfully created and the identity info page will be shown. This identity will now be available
    for use within your [workload's identity](/api-reference/workload#identity) setting.

## [Cloud Access](#cloud-access)

The cloud access portion of an identity defines cloud resource access rules across one account in each of
AWS, GCP and Azure. In other words, you can create an identity that allows access to several resources in a
particular AWS account and a particular Azure account, but not in two separate Azure accounts.

When defining the policy for a particular cloud provider, Control Plane creates and manages
(using the registered [cloud account](/api-reference/cloudaccount)) the following object at each cloud provider which acts as
a "synthetic identity":

- AWS
  - Role
- Azure
  - App registration
- GCP
  - Service Account

The minimum set of permissions required by the [workload](/api-reference/workload) to call the target cloud resources should be assigned to the cloud access policy.

When [workloads](/api-reference/workload) call the cloud resource, they call the services by impersonating the "synthetic identity".
This "synthetic identity" will only have the permission that were assigned to it.

Having multiple cloud providers configured on an [identity](/api-reference/identity) using cloud access rules grants the [workload](/api-reference/workload)
the ability to call cloud resources at any cloud provider seamlessly and transparently regardless of where it running.

Below are instructions on how to set up cloud access rules using the console for:

- [AWS](#cloud-access-aws)
- [Azure](#cloud-access-azure)
- [GCP](#cloud-access-gcp)

### [AWS](#cloud-access-aws)

To set up an AWS cloud access policy using the console, click on the AWS icon and the wizard modal will appear.

1. Select one of the registered AWS [cloud accounts](/api-reference/cloudaccount)
2. Select one of the following methods and click `Next`:

   - Reuse an existing AWS role:
     - A list of roles will be shown.
     - Either select a role from the list or click the `Edit Manually` button and enter a role name. Click `Confirm Manual Input` when done.
     - Verify the role name is correct and click `Done`.
   - Configure a new AWS role with existing policies:
     - A list of available policies will be shown.
     - The policy list can be created by:
       - Selecting at least one role from the list, or
       - Click the `Set Policies Manually` button and manually enter the policy name and click `Add`. Multiple policies can be added
         manually. Click `Set Policies From List` to return to the existing policies list.
       - Click `Done`.

After setting up the AWS cloud access rule, a summary of the selections will be shown. Verify that the policies selected are
correct and at the bottom of the page, click `Save`. If a new AWS role was selected, Control Plane will provision a new role in AWS
that will be named the same as the `Object Name` shown in the `Info` page of the [identity](/api-reference/identity).

### [Azure](#cloud-access-azure)

To set up an Azure cloud access policy using the console, click on the Azure icon and the wizard modal will appear.

1. Select one of the registered Azure [cloud accounts](/api-reference/cloudaccount).
2. Click `Next`.
3. Construct the role assignments:
   - Click `Select Scope` to show the scope selection wizard. Choose the service, region, type, and scope. Click `Confirm`.
   - Click `Select Roles` to show the list of available roles for the selected scope. Select one or more roles. Click `Confirm`.
   - If additional role assignments are needed, click `Add Assignment` at the top of the modal. Repeat the first two steps.
   - Click `Done`.

After setting up the Azure cloud access policy, a summary of the selections will be shown. Verify that the roles selected are correct and
at the bottom of the page, click `Save`. Control Plane will provision a new App registration in Azure that will be named the same as
the `Object Name` shown in the `Info` page of the [identity](/api-reference/identity).

### [GCP](#cloud-access-gcp)

To set up a GCP cloud access policy using the console, click on the GCP icon and the wizard modal will appear.

1. Select one of the registered GCP [cloud accounts](/api-reference/cloudaccount)
2. Select one of the following methods and click `Next`:

   - Reuse an existing GCP service account:
     - A list of service accounts will be shown.
     - Either select a service account from the list or click the `Edit Manually` button and enter a service account name. Click `Confirm Manual Input` when done.
     - Verify the service account name is correct and click `Done`.
   - Configure a new GCP service account:
     - Construct a new binding:
       - Click `Select Resource` to show the resource selection wizard. Choose the service, region, type, and resource. Click `Confirm`.
       - Click `Select Roles` to show the list of available roles for the selected resource. Select one or more roles. Click `Confirm`.
       - If additional bindings are needed, click `Add Binding` at the top of the modal. Repeat the first two steps.
       - Click `Done`

After setting up the GCP cloud access policy, a summary of the selections will be shown. Verify that the roles selected are correct and
at the bottom of the page, click `Save`. If a new service account was selected, Control Plane will provision the new Service Account in GCP
that will be named the same as the `Object Name` shown in the `Info` page of the [identity](/api-reference/identity).

## [Network Resource](#network-resource)

The network resource portion of an [identity](/api-reference/identity) defines network traversal rules from
[workloads](/api-reference/workload) into specific endpoints in private networks (e.g., a VPC).

Tunneling network traffic from [workloads](/api-reference/workload) to specific TCP hosts and ports is facilitated using
[agents](/api-reference/agent) deployed within the private network. This capability is referred to as “wormholes”.

To set up a new network resource, click the `Network Resources` link and click `Add Network Resource`.

1. Select a registered [agent](/api-reference/agent) matching the environment you'd like to access.
2. Enter a unique `name` for this resource.

   **Note:** This name will be the hostname your [workload](/api-reference/workload) will use when calling this resource.

3. Choose one of the following resource discovery methods:

   - Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN):

     - Enter the FQDN of the internal resource.
     - Optionally, enter the internal IP address that the above FQDN will resolve to.
     - Enter at least one port that the resource exposes.

     **Note:** When selecting FQDN, the internal resource can be called by the workload using either the FQDN or the `name` entered in step 2.
     If the internal resource is configured with TLS, the FQDN must be used.

   - IP:

     - Enter at least one IP address.
     - Enter at least one port.

     **Note:** When selecting IP, the internal resource is called by the workload using the `name` entered in step 2.

<Info>
A maximum of **5** ports can be added.
</Info>

4. If additional resources are needed, click the `Add Network Resource` button again and repeat the steps above.
5. After setting up the necessary resources, verify that they are correct and at the bottom of the page, click `Save`.
