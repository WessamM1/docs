title:  Create a Policy
---

## [Overview](#overview)

Follow the steps below to create a [policy](/api-reference/policy) defining access permissions to any Control Plane resource for
any principal ([user](/api-reference/user), [service account](/api-reference/serviceaccount), [group](/api-reference/group), and [identity](/api-reference/identity)).

## [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

- Review the [policy](/api-reference/policy) reference page
- [Permissions](/api-reference/policy#permissions) to create a [policy](/api-reference/policy)
- Optional:
  - Install the [CLI](/api-reference/cli)

## [Create using the UI Console](#create-cloud-account-ui)

1. Create a new policy by either:
   - Clicking `Policies` in the left menu and click `New`, or
   - Click the `Create` dropdown in the upper right corner and select `Policy`
2. Select Resource Type:
   - Enter a policy name and optional description
   - Select a target resource type
     - Choose one of the resource types that you'd like to control access to
     - You have the option to select specific resources or target all the resources in your [org](/api-reference/org) by turning on the `Target All` switch
     - If you are targeting all the resources, click `Next` and skip to step 4.
     - Click `Next`
3. Select Specific Resources:
   - Choose one or both of the following methods to select resources:
     - Directly assigned:
       - A list of available resources will be shown and can be selected
     - Dynamically assigned:
       - Using the [tag query](/api-reference/misc#tags) form, configure the match by rule.
   - Click `Next`
4. Add a Binding:
   - At least one binding is required. Click `Add Binding`.
   - Select one or more permissions. These permissions are specific to the selected resource type.
   - Browse through the principal tabs and select at least one principal. Click `Add`.
   - If required, add additional bindings. Note: The bindings must have a unique set of permissions. Click `Create`.
   - The policy has been created and is now active

## [Create using the CLI](#create-cli)

Refer to the [policy create](/api-reference/cli#policy-create) and [policy add-binding](/api-reference/cli#policy-add-binding)
commands for details and examples on how to create a policy and binding using the CLI.

## [Summary](#summary)

Control Plane [policies](/api-reference/policy) allow for fine-grained authorization to the resources within your [org](/api-reference/org).
By granting to principals only the permissions they need to get their job done, policies limit the information they can view
and actions they can perform. Most applications and services running on the platform are mission-critical and authorized principals should only have the
access they require.
