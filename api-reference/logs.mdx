title:  Logs
---

## [Overview](#overview)

The logs UI displays the logs for your running [workloads](workload). No matter which combination of cloud providers or regions your
workload is running at, the logs will be aggregated and displayed as if they were running at one provider/region.

[Filters](#log-filters) can be applied to pinpoint any issues that might be occurring at a specific [workload](workload).

The [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/) explorer is available to query and visualize your log data.

## [Sample Log UI](#ui)

Below is a sample of the Log UI after executing a query:

## [LogQL](#logql)

The Control Plane logs use the LogQL query language to query your log data.

The documentation for LogQL is available [here](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/logql/).

The available labels that can be used to create a query are:

- container
- gvc
- location
- replica
- stream
- workload

## [Log Filters](#log-filters)

The results of a query can be filtered by the following:

- [Location](/api-reference/location)
- [Container](workload#containers)
- Start date and optional end date
  - The date/time selector includes helper buttons ranging from the `Last 5 minutes` to the `Last 30 days`
  - <img
      src="/img/api-reference/log-ui-date-selector.png"
      alt="Date Selector"
      width="380"
    />

Selecting a [location](/api-reference/location) or [container](workload#containers) will automatically add the value to the LogQL query.

## [Live Logs](#live-logs)

The results of the given query can be streamed in real-time using the `Live` button.

After entering the desired query, click the `Live` button`.

To end the live streaming, click the `Stop` button.

## [Grafana](#grafana)

Clicking on the `Explore on Grafana` link will launch the Grafana UI in a new tab. When clicking the button from a specific
[workload](workload), the query will be prefilled with the [GVC](/api-reference/gvc) and [workload](workload).

Grafana gives you the ability to "Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic
drill-down. Split view and compare different time ranges, queries, and data sources side by side."

View the documentation for Grafana [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/).

## [Example LogQL Queries](#example)

- View the logs for a specific [GVC](/api-reference/gvc) and [workload](workload)

```
{gvc="GVC_NAME", workload="WORKLOAD_NAME"}
```

- View the logs for a GVC, workload, location, and container

```
{gvc="GVC_NAME", workload="WORKLOAD_NAME", location="aws-eu-central-1", container="CONTAINER_NAME"}
```

## [Log Retention Policy](#log-retention)

The log retention period for logs stored at Control Plane is 30 days by default and can be adjusted for each Org.
