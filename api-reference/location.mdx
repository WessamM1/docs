title:  Locations

## [Overview](#overview)

Locations show the available geographical locations for each of the following cloud providers:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Microsoft Azure

Locations are scoped to an [org](/api-reference/org) and the [org](/api-reference/org) administrator can turn off/on the locations that
are permitted when configuring a [GVC](/api-reference/gvc).

By default, all locations are enabled. If a location is disabled, any [workloads](workload) within that location will
be removed. Further, if a location is enabled, all [workloads](workload) will be provisioned to that location.

<Note>
If a company is restricted for legal or compliance reasons to only use certain cloud providers, disabling those providers 
will ensure that workloads will not be deployed to those providers.
</Note>

## [Locations](#locations)

Control Plane can enable any cloud provider location.

If a location is not shown, please email [support@controlplane.com](mailto:support@controlplane.com) with the provider and location and it will be provisioned.

## [Built-in Tags](#tags)

Each location has the following built-in [tags](misc#tags):

- `cpln/city=VALUE`
- `cpln/country=VALUE`
- `cpln/continent=VALUE`
