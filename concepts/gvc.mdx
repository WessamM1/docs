title: GVC (Global Virtual Cloud)
---

## [Overview](#overview)

A Global Virtual Cloud (/api-reference/gvc) defines a set of cloud providers and their [locations](/api-reference/location).

When creating a GVC you are in essence building an uber-cloud that is comprised of the specified [locations](/api-reference/location).
[Workloads](workload) are deployed to the GVC which are then served from all the [locations](/api-reference/location)
specified.

Each [org](/api-reference/org) can have multiple GVCs, each with its own unique set of [locations](/api-reference/location).

A [domain name](/api-reference/domain) can be assigned to a GVC. Callers can reach [workloads](workload) using the
assigned [domain name](/api-reference/domain).

## [Benefits](#benefits)

- GVCs enable your [workload](workload) to be deployed with ease to multiple cloud providers and locations
  - You choose the provider (AWS, Azure, and GCP) and their different locations
  - Select [locations](/api-reference/location) that are close to your end-users
  - Select the [locations](/api-reference/location) that fulfill the requirements of your workloads
  - Ensure maximum availability if a cloud provider has an occasional outage
- You get granular controls to define the scaling characteristics of your [workload](workload)

## [Domain Name](#domain-name)

Each GVC can be set to use one of the fully qualified [domain names](/api-reference/domain) that have been mapped to an [org](/api-reference/org).

The selected [domain name](/api-reference/domain) will be used by all [workloads](workload) when serving their containers.

The default domain name `cpln.app` will be used if an [org](/api-reference/org) does not have any domains configured, or if you do not
select a [domain name](/api-reference/domain).

## [Pull Secrets](#pull-secrets)

Pull secrets are [secrets](/api-reference/secret) that are assigned to a GVC and used by [workloads](workload) when authentication 
is required when pulling an image from a private registry. Only the [Docker](/api-reference/secret#docker), [Amazon ECR](/api-reference/secret#ecr), and [GCP](/api-reference/secret#gcp) 
[secret](/api-reference/secret) types are supported.

<Tip>
If the image was pushed to the Control Plane registry for the same [org](/api-reference/org), no secret is required.
</Tip>

Multiple pull secrets can be assigned to a GVC. A [workload's container](workload) will use the appropriate secret when pulling the 
image from a private registry. If there are multiple secrets, the container will cycle through each one.

If authentication fails, the deployment will not be updated and the image pull will have an exponential backoff retry starting
at 10 seconds until 5 minutes (e.g., 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 40 seconds, etc.).
