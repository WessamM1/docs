title: Principal Types
---

## [Overview](#overview)

A “principal” is somewhat of an overloaded term representing an “identity”.

The Control Plane Platform supports 4 principal types.

 Each principal type is scoped to an [org](/api-reference/org) and can be granted permissions to certain resources or whole resource types through [policies](/api-reference/policy).

1. [Users](/api-reference/user)

   A [user](/api-reference/user) represents a distinct human being. This principal type is associated with an email. A user is a member of one or
   more [orgs](/api-reference/org). An authorized principal can invite users (by providing their email address) to an [org](/api-reference/org).

2. [Service Accounts](/api-reference/serviceaccount)

   A [service account](/api-reference/serviceaccount) is a non-human, often an application that is utilized to consume the [API](/api-reference/api).

3. [Groups](/api-reference/group)

   A [group](/api-reference/group) is a named collection of [users](/api-reference/user) and [service account](/api-reference/serviceaccount).
   When inviting users to an [org](/api-reference/org), a [group](/api-reference/group) can optionally be specified.

4. [Identity](/api-reference/identity)

   An [identity](/api-reference/identity) is short for workload identity. It is a reusable (can be leveraged by multiple workloads)
   named principal that is only used by [workloads](workload). An identity encapsulates a set of
   [Cloud Access](/api-reference/identity#cloud-access) rules. [Cloud Access](/api-reference/identity#cloud-access)
   rules define least privilege policies governing access to resources in the [org's](/api-reference/org) configured
   [cloud accounts](/api-reference/cloudaccount). In addition to [Cloud Access](/api-reference/identity#cloud-access) rules,
   an [identity](/api-reference/identity) also defines a set of [Network Resources](/api-reference/identity#network-resource).

## [Examples](#examples)

- To allow a user or group access to perform actions within the console, an administrator would create a [policy](/api-reference/policy)
  that bounds the user or group to the resource and the necessary permissions.

- To allow a [workload](workload) the ability to access secured resources within Control Plane (e.g., a secret used as an
  environment variable), an identity is created that is a member of a [policy](/api-reference/policy) with the
  required binding.
