title: Accessing Cloud Resources
---

## [Overview](#overview)

The Control Plane platform enables your [workloads](/api-reference/workload), regardless of the cloud provider and location it is running
at, to consume native services from different cloud providers in a least-privilege manner, without requiring developers to embed credentials
to consume those services (e.g., S3, Dynamo, Big Query, etc.).

This capability is **optional**.

It is provided to alleviate the many facets of credential management. By leveraging this capability, the running of workloads
is more straightforward. This approach is utilized by cloud providers who term it “temporary session credentials”. See this [link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html)
to review how AWS uses temporary credentials.

Customers choosing to define fine-grained access that allows a [workload](/api-reference/workload) to access cloud resources must perform the following:

- Register with Control Plane a [cloud account](/api-reference/cloudaccount) for each cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) that hosts the
  resources your workload requires
- Create an [identity](/api-reference/identity) and assign the desired [cloud access](/guides/create-identity#cloud-access) to resources
  within each registered [cloud account](/api-reference/cloudaccount)
- Assign the [identity](/api-reference/identity) to a [workload](/api-reference/workload). Only one identity can be assigned to a particular
  workload. [Identities](/api-reference/identity) can be re-used by multiple workloads and have the same set of permissions.

For Control Plane to provision and de-provision the [identity's](/api-reference/identity) access to consume native cloud services, Control Plane
must be able to:

- Create `Roles` in AWS
- Create `App registrations` in Azure
- Create `Service Accounts` in GCP

For additional details on this process, refer to the [cloud account](/api-reference/cloudaccount) reference page for each cloud provider:

- [AWS](/api-reference/cloudaccount#aws-details)
- [Azure](/api-reference/cloudaccount#azure-details)
- [GCP](/api-reference/cloudaccount#gcp-details)
